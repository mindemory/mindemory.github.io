Mindemory is a space I created to slow down and reflect on some of the deeper questions that often go unspoken. 
It's an attempt at understanding what makes us who we are by looking through the lenses of philosophy, science, and history. 
At its core, this blog / my braingasm is driven by a quiet but persistent curiosity about the mind, memory, and identity. 
My first attempt at this began in 2017 via <a href="https://mindemory.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">ThoughtPost</a> but never really took off. 
But I have found myself coming back to these thoughts time and again, either impromptu or via discussions with friends. Mindemory feels like a natural 
space to channel and explore these thoughts more systematically.
<br><br>

Through my research in neuroscience and my own lived experiences, I have often found myself circling around the same questions. 
What defines a person? How do memories shape us over time? Can science explain who we are, or do we also need to turn to philosophy, art, 
and the past to get closer to the truth? These aren't questions I expect to fully answer, but I believe they're worth asking, again and again.<br><br>

The blog will be loosely organized around three themes:<br>
<ul>
  <li><b>Philosophical Musings</b>: questions about consciousness, ethics, meaning, and identity</li>
  <li><b>Scientific Curiosities</b>: topics in neuroscience, cognition, and how the brain processes the world</li>
  <li><b>Historical Insights</b>: stories from the past that help us understand how people have thought about themselves and others over time</li>
</ul>

This isn't a space for hot takes (maybe!). It's more like a quiet notebook where I can explore ideas at my own pace and hopefully offer something thoughtful for anyone reading. 
I am just hoping to connect with others who enjoy thinking deeply, slowly, and with care.<br><br>

If that sounds like you, I am glad you are here.<br><br>
Welcome to Mindemory.
